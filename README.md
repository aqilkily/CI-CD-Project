# This is the README for the CI/CD project

Hello there! This is my repository practice to showcase some of the CI/CD that i have learnt in **DevOps** from the fintech course I am currently in.

I have produced a simple mini game which is used as my application source code.

Along with it I have included two workflows;

1)The first would be for my code build and test whenever there is a git push/pull request to/from repository

2)The second would be receiving telegram notification whenever there is a git push command to the repository

Feel free to try the game out!


First, clone this repository into your preferred directory

``
$ git clone https://github.com/aqilkily/CI-CD-Project.git
``

Change directory into the cloned folder

``
$ cd CI-CD-Project
``

Build a web server to run the game on

``
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
``

Click web preview near the top right of the page

Lastly, enjoy!


:)
